# An A/B Test to help CDC best deliver COVID Prevention Information

This test was conducted as a part of the course A/B Testing (95-819), taught by Professor Pedro Ferreira. 

### The following was done as a part of this project:
• Performed a study to measure the effectiveness of different forms of information delivery on COVID-19 prevention information.
• Used Qualtrics to create a survey and randomize 130 respondents into treatment and control groups.
• Employed a 'Difference in Differences' model to measure the causal effect of COVID-19 information when delivered via an infographic versus plain text.
